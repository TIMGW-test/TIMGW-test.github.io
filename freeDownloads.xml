            The Lord establishes our plans and we will only do what we intend if He allows!

            "In their hearts humans plan their course,
            but the Lord establishes their steps."
            Proverbs 16:9</description>

        <title>Share the Gospel! - Cards to Gift the Good News</title>
        <description>
            Do you have a passion for sahring about Jesus but you don't know where to start?
            Download and print these cards. Put a simple coffee card inside and find someone to gift
            this to! Don't be afraid, simply ask, "Can I share the gospel with you?" Share as much
            as you want in that moment and gift them this card. We must work the harvest feilds,
            friend! Jesus said the harvest is plentiful. If we believe Him we simply must labor for
            this! There's no time to wait, no time to waste. Jesus specifically gave the reminder at
            the end of the Great Commission that He is with us always, even to the end of the age!
            We are within that promise so: JESUS IS WITH US!
            We do not go alone to share the Good News of Jesus!

            “Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given
            to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
            Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I
            have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.'”
            Matthew 28:18-20 NIV
