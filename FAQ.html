                  Lord willing, this will be a three-year cycle that I intend to use twice in our children's
                  elementary years. My hope and prayer is that all three cycles will be completed for K-5th by the end
                  of 2024.
                  The teacher's guide for each year should be saved and may be used again,
                  while student workbooks are consumable and you will need one at the grade
                  level of each child you are homeschooling that matches the corresponding cycle you are working
                  through.

                  Yes! By the beginning of 2024 the preschool workbook and cycles 1 and 2 should be available to
                  purchase through Amazon.
                  This is the most affordable printing I have found. I am sorry I am unable to ship directly and cannot
                  accept returns.
                  We do not profit from the sale of the printed books. We offer this option simply as a service to you.
                  The prices of the books range based on the lowest cost that Amazon will allow me to offer them.
                  I have heard other homeschool families have been able to take similar books to Office Depot and have
                  the spine cut off and the book spiral bound.
                  You may want to consider that for the Student Workbooks as it makes work pages and writing easier.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  My encouragement to you on printing if purchasing isn't an option:
                  If your children are enrolled where you receive allotment funds consider how you can utilize those in
                  printing this.
                  You are not actually paying for any Christian content so you would simply be using funding for
                  printing services or
                  ink/paper/spiral binding. See if your school system can work with you to reimburse you!

                  We are not affiliated with any denomination.
                  We love the Lord and believe that Jesus is the Messiah. "That It May Go Well"
                  is written with value for both the Old Testament and the New Testament. We try
                  to stick with Scripture and validate all lessons from the Bible. Each cycle has
                  been/will be written to help you teach your children to be Biblically literate, hide God's Word
                  in their hearts, live a kingdom-first lifestyle, actively share the Gospel, and be able to defend
                  the faith. We believe that all Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, correcting,
                  and training in righteousness. While the New Testament was being written, the Old Testament was the
                  Scriptures that they had and searched to find out if the things spoken about Jesus were true.
                  We believe there is immense value in knowing both and understanding the story of Scripture from
                  beginning to end, from Genesis to Revelation.

                  As always, we welcome you to make this fit for your family.
                  If there is something within the curriculum that your family disagrees with I encourage
                  you to teach your child, from the Bible, what you see differently. Over the years there
                  were many times I had to pause in resources we used and explain to our children, from the
                  Bible, why this wasn't exactly the way we believe. Because humans are fallible and I believe
                  that you are the best one to educate your child, I welcome you to use what is supplied in
                  "That It May Go Well" and omit anything that doesn't line up with what you believe.

                  Yes, as a hybrid approach, we do utilize other books, sometimes called "Living Books". You will need a
                  world atlas for cycle 1, a USA atlas for cycle 2 (or a similar book for your country), and books to
                  study historical people and events of interest to you and your children. We also encourage you to have
                  a variety of age-appropriate reading material available for your children for their individual reading
