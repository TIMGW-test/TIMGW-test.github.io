                Thanks for stopping by. Lamp and Light exists to share God's Word and to see His Kingdom come and His will be done. The heart behind the time invested in Lamp & Light Living is really about a lifestyle of living each day with God in our hearts and His Word as our guide.
                <br>

              We are a homeschool family of six living in Alaska.  We enjoy spending time in God's creation and Alaska has been an amazing place for our family to enjoy it.  Meghann is the creative content manager of Lamp and Light.  Developing homeschool curriculum, Bible studies, and creating beautiful handmade jewelry, are just a small piece of her contribution to Lamp and Light.  Chad is a former fishing guide and currently works in the oil fields.  He serves behind the scenes assisting with editing and content ideas.  We are joined by our 4 children, Angler, Rill, Hadassah, and Delta.  Our main job is raising arrows for the Kingdom and sharing our ideas and small parts of our lives with you!
